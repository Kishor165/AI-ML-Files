📝 Project Description: This project analyzes the daily working hours of 30 employees over a period of 30 days using Python. The dataset is synthetically generated using NumPy and analyzed using the Pandas library for data processing, with Seaborn and Matplotlib used for visualization.

🔍 Key Features: Synthetic Dataset Generation:

30 employees (EMP_001 to EMP_030)

30 days of data from July 1, 2025 to July 30, 2025

Random working hours between 4 to 10 hours

CSV Export & Import:

Data is exported to employee_working_hours.csv and re-imported for analysis

Analysis Performed:

Total working hours per employee

Average daily working hours

Flags for unusually low (< 5 hours) or high (> 9 hours) working days

Distribution analysis of total working hours

Visualizations:

Bar chart of top 10 employees by total working hours

Line chart comparison of the same

Histogram showing the distribution of total working hours across all employees

📦 Libraries Used: pandas – data manipulation

numpy – dataset generation

matplotlib & seaborn – data visualization
